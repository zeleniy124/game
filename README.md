## ABOUT p5js :speech_balloon:

### Basic sketch
  - This is the basic setup for a p5.js sketch- **setup()** and **draw()**. 
  - **Note:** p5.js will also require an empty HTML file that links to the p5.js library and your sketch file in the header.

    ```javascript
    function setup() {
      // setup stuff
    }
    function draw() {
      // draw stuff
    }
    ```
    
  - Alternatively, you could use the **preload()** function. 
  - If a preload() block exists it runs first, then setup() will wait until everything in there has completed before it gets run, so you can make use of things loaded in preload in setup and draw.
  
    ```javascript
    let img;
    function preload() {
      img = loadImage('img.jpg');
    }
    ```
